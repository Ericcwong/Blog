      <h2 class="title">Hello, Eric here.</h2>
      <p>
        I've been on Earth for 23 years. I don't know if this has happened to
        you like after 18 and 21 the milestone ages. You just forget how old you
        are. When someone asked, "how old are you?" I paused for second and had
        to think, "22? wait no i'm 23. Yeah, 23." Anyways, I live in Utah a calm
        and peaceful state. What I love to do is spend time with my girlfriend
        Elizabeth (Liz is what most of my family calls her.) so you would see a
        lot of her on this blog. Play games with my guy friends, we mostly play
        League of Legends but it can vary depending on the mood. Lately we've
        been playing this ghost hunting game Phasmophobia. Lastly is going out
        and traveling but with Covid-19 it has been hard. It just means that
        next year means a lot of traveling!
